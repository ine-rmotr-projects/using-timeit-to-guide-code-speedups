    "In this course, the videos made passing reference to the fact that the library Numba can often speedup numeric computation.  You are very unlikely to do better than Numba does for this problem.  However, your task is to utilize **different** refactoring techniques to make the rendering a Mandelbrot fractal faster, but still product the same results.  You may define for yourself what \"the same\" means.  That is, since the Mandelbrot set is actually the limit of infinitely many iterations, it is *possible* that a pixel or two may wind up with a different value in your alternate approach to finite iteration.  But most should be the same.\n",
