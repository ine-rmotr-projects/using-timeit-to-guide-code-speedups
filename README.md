# Using timeit to guide code speedups

This project lets you speed up code by using accurate timing of existing code, and comparing times as you make changes.

In this project, you will be work with a version of the Fractal software library this course uses throughout to demonstrate various Python software development tools.  This same library is used for other purposes in other INE courses.  The version of the library you will need for these exercises is at:

> https://github.com/ine-rmotr-projects/INE-Fractal/tree/softwaredev

Other branches of that repository will contain somewhat different versions of the library, and many projects in this course will not make sense in relation to them.

Start with the Notebook `Project.ipynb`, and best of luck!
